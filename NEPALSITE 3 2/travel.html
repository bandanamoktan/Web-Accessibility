<h2>Kathmandu</h2>

Colorful  Kathmandu is a must-see on any trip to Nepal. The capital city is a hugely popular tourist destination, despite huge amounts of damage from the 2015 earthquake, and for good reason. There are so many sights to see within the city, including the Buddhist temple Swayambhunath, the remains of the Hanuman Dhoka, and Golden Temple (or Kwa Bahal), a Buddhist monastery. The sometimes chaotic city is full of smells, sounds, and people, and the streets are always packed with rickshaws and slow-moving traffic. Kathmandu is a fun place to spend a few dizzyingly wonderful days.</p>


<h2>Lumbini</h2>

<div class="lumbini">
<p> 
    

Lumbini is one of the most historically important towns in Nepal, as it is home to the birthplace of Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha, in 563 BC, as well as some of the country’s most important archeological finds that date back to the third century BC. You can visit Lumbini’s peaceful monasteries in the wooded park or spend time relaxing in the gardens. Interestingly, the area around Lumbini is predominantly Muslim, but the city is an important place for Buddhist pilgrims from around the world. A newly designed religious park is a long-time work in progress meant to revitalize the often-forgotten city. You could spend a few hours exploring the small area of Lumbini or you could spend days basking in the city’s peaceful vibes.    </p>

<h2>Pokhara</h2>

<div class="pokhara">
<p>
Pokhara is the second largest city in Nepal. It is the starting point for most of the treks in the Annapurna area.Tourist buses (NPR600-900, 6-7h) and crowded local buses/microbuses (NPR400-600, 6-7h) travel the 200km journey between Kathmandu and Pokhara almost every 15 minutes starting at 07:30 through late afternoon. Night buses are available, but the ride is painful. Greenline operates a convenient bus every morning between the popular tourist areas of Thamel in Kathmandu and Lakeside in Pokhara (USD23, lunch included). </p>
